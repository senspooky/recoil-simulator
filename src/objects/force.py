        Get the force applied to an arbitrary object over a given interval of 
        time.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        start: float
            The start time of the interval, measured in seconds. Typically, this
            is the time in the simulation that the impulse begins to act on
            an object.
            
            Note: if start is not specified, then an exception is raised.
        end: float
            The end time of the interval, measured in seconds. Typically, this
            is the time in the simulation that the impulse stops acting on
            an object.
            
            Note: if end is not specified, then the interval is assumed to be
            from start to start + interval. If both end and interval are not
            specified, then an exception is raised.
        interval: float
            The length of the interval, measured in seconds. Typically, this
            is the time in the simulation that the impulse acts on an object.
            
            Note: if interval is not specified, then the interval is assumed to
            be from start to end. If both end and interval are not specified,
            then an exception is raised.
        
        Returns
        -------
        f: np.ndarray[float]
            The force applied by the impulse over the given interval of time,
            measured in Newtons. It is represented as a 2D vector, where the
            x-component is the force applied in the x-direction, and the
            y-component is the force applied in the y-direction. Returns None
            if the interval takes place after the impulse has ended.
